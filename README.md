## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Code Standards:** Please ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards. We use **ESLint** for linting and **Prettier** for formatting.
2. **Testing:** All new features and bug fixes must include tests. We use **Jest** for unit tests.
3. **Documentation:** Any changes or new features should be accompanied by appropriate documentation updates. The documentation guideline is as follows;

- First, Ensure functions, classes, or modules are documented inline (using comments or documentation blocks). Also mention the feature the changes is for
- docs/features.md - Explains newly added features.
- docs/api.md - Detailed API documentation.
- docs/configuration.md - Advanced configuration options
- CHANGELOG.md - This is where you list changes, bug fixes, new features, and updates. This file would include entries for new features with links to more detailed documentation in the docs/folder. Find example entry below:

## Using GitHub Projects for Project Management

GitHub Projects is used in this project for managing tasks, Collaborate effectively, stay organized, and keep track of project progress in a transparent manner and tracking the progress of the project in an organized way.
You can find the project board here: [T4dWallet project](https://github.com/pelumiadebayo/T4dWallet/projects)

### Why We Use GitHub Projects?

1. **To Visualize Workflows**: GitHub Projects allows you to create **Kanban-style boards** that help visualize workflows, from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done."
   
2. **To Track Progress**: It helps track the status of issues, pull requests, and tasks. This is especially useful for coordinating between multiple contributors.

3. **To Prioritize Work**: Organize issues and tasks by priority so everyone knows what to focus on next.

### How to Use GitHub Projects for effective project management.

1. **Access the Project Board**: Navigate to the **Projects** tab within the GitHub repository to view the project board. The board consists of columns, typically labeled "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
   
2. **Add Issues/Tasks to the Board**:
- Issues and pull requests from the repository can be added to the project board.
- You can also create tasks within the project board directly.

3. **Track Task Status**: Each task moves through columns as it progresses. Contributors can drag and drop cards between columns to update their status;
- **To Do**: Tasks or issues that need attention.
- **In Progress**: Tasks actively being worked on.
- **Done**: Completed tasks/issues.

4. **Use Milestones**: Organize your tasks by setting **milestones**, which are goals or deadlines you want to achieve. Milestones allow you to group issues and pull requests into specific releases or phases of the project.

5. **Assign Contributors**: You can assign contributors to specific issues or tasks on the board. This helps clarify responsibility and ensures the right people are working on the right tasks.

6. **Use Labels**: Use labels to categorize tasks by type (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`). This helps organize work and makes it easier to filter tasks based on whatâ€™s important.

### Example Workflow:

1. **Create a Task**: Someone creates a new issue in the repository (e.g., "Add payment gateway integration").
   
2. **Add the Issue to the Project**: The issue is added to the "To Do" column in the GitHub Project board.

3. **Assign and Prioritize**: A team member is assigned to the issue, and itâ€™s labeled with `high priority`.

4. **Move to In Progress**: When the team member starts working on the issue, they move the card to the "In Progress" column.

5. **Completion**: Once the work is done and the pull request is merged, the card is moved to the "Done" column.
